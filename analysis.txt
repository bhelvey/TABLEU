One phenomenon that was discovered when looking at the data is that bikes are clearly clustered
in 4-6 key points around the city. This being important because when a technician or employee goes
to retrieve bikes makes easier for pickup and servicing of multiple bikes. Time is important because
we want to maximize profitable bike on road time we need to see when use is at its lowest and
as shown we can see lowest use time for bikes is between 0100-0400. In addition another phenomenon
inside the bikes clusters is that there are some bikes that tend to stay in there home cluster of high frequency use.
So by cycling high use bikes to low use areas this will prevent wear and tear on bikes and frequency of cost to fix bikes.
